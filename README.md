# Amazon_Vine_Analysis
Module 17

## Overview of the analysis

Jennifer needs to perform the analysis on effectiveness of the Amazon Program called “vine” where customers are send products and they need to submit an “honest” review vs regular reviews which customer submits upon buying an online product through Amazon. We are given 50 databases to chose from and we will pick “watches” as our product/merchandise. We will use AWW Amazon program to load data into, then we will use google colab to run the codes and to create data tables for analysis and populate them with results. 

## Results

After running our code we calculated that non vine program produced 960,872 reviews, all mixed from 1 to 5 stars.
Vine Program produced the total of 8,409 reviews.

For Five star review analysis we got 4,347 reviews in Vine program and 571,627 of reviews for non Vine Program.


To better understand the results we converted those 5 star reviews into percentage and got 52% for Vine Program and 59% for regular 5 star reviews.

## Summary

After our research we can conclude that Vine program is not very effective. It produces less 5* reviews (by 7%) plus company loosing money on sending free products out. Quality of the product is sufficient enough that it can supply 5* reviews.
