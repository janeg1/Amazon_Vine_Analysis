# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

Module 17

## Overview.

Analyze Amazon reviews written by members of the paid Amazon Vine program. The Amazon Vine program is a service that allows manufacturers and publishers to receive reviews for their products. Companies like SellBy pay a small fee to Amazon and provide products to Amazon Vine members, who are then required to publish a review.

## Results.

*Total reviews 960,872
*Vine program total reviews 8,409
*Vine program 5star reviews total 4,347
*Non Vine 5star reviews total 567,280
*Percentage of Vine 5star reviews 52%
*Percentage of non-Vine reviews were 5 stars 59%

Based on this numbers we can conclude that program is effective in terms of producing results close to results of Non Vine program but at cost. So this makes it not effective, because based on quality of the product it will get 5 star reviews no matter if you send out free product or not, but company can save on not sending free staff, unless they need to generate more reviews.
